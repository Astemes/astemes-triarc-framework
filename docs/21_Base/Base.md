# Base

The `Base` class is a common ancestor for processes and may also be used to create components which do not run asynchronously.
The `Base` class is responsible for storing the base name of the class, which is imutable and assigned on initialization.
Additionally the class implements scaffolding which is used by the `Configuration Interface` methods.
